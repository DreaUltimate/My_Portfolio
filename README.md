Welcome to my portfolio!

This portfolio was built using several modern web development tools and libraries, including Framer Motion, React Tilt, Redux Toolkit, Three.js, and a modern UI.

Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that allows for fluid and expressive animations. I used it to create visually stunning and engaging animations throughout the site, helping to draw the user's attention and create a more immersive experience.

React Tilt is a library that allows for the creation of 3D tilt animations in React components. I used it to create dynamic and interactive 3D elements throughout the site, giving the user a sense of depth and interactivity.

Redux Toolkit is a powerful state management library that simplifies the process of managing complex application state. I used it to manage the state of the portfolio's various components and ensure that everything was working seamlessly together.

Three.js is a powerful 3D graphics library that allows for the creation of stunning 3D graphics and animations in the browser. I used it to create a variety of 3D elements throughout the site, including the rotating 3D logo on the homepage.

Finally, the portfolio features a modern UI that is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate. I used a combination of modern design principles, including flat design, bold typography, and a clean layout, to create a site that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Overall, this portfolio is the result of careful planning, attention to detail, and the use of cutting-edge web development tools and techniques. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!
